| vit‑chest‑xray      | ViT (image classifier) | 5-way disease classification         | High accuracy, direct classification ([huggingface.co][1], [github.com][2]) |
give good results and also have fast api that we can classify xrays (to understand what are the classes 1,2,3)

20250708 - I ran the model and I got result dir 01 and 03 are not classified correctly however dir 02 seems to be normal 
I didn't fine tune the model...
